## Spring Email

The Spring Framework provides a helpful utility library for sending email that shields you from the specifics of the underlying mailing system and is responsible for low-level resource handling on behalf of the client.

In this project I have shown how to send a simple email. 

For sending mails with attachments you can utilize the **MimeMessage Interface** and **MimeMessageHelper class** to compose email with attachments and send.
